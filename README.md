This project is based on the [Project 2](http://cs61b.ug/sp15/materials/proj/proj1/proj1.html) of Berkeley CS 61B course in SP2015.

It offers tools to explore ho the volume of printed works in English has changed over time, as well as the structure of the is-a relationships of words in English. 

The data required for the program to work can be downloaded from http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hug/p1data.zip
